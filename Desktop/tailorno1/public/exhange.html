   <h2> Exchange Policy </h2>
<br><br>
Thank you for shopping with us! We want you to love your purchase, but if you’re not completely satisfied, we’re happy to help you with an exchange.

1. Eligibility for Exchange

We offer exchanges on most items, provided they meet the following conditions:
The item is in its original, unused, and unwashed condition.
The item is returned within 30 days of purchase.
The item has the original tags still attached.
The item is not on sale, clearance, or a final sale.

<br><br>
2. How to Request an Exchange To initiate an exchange:

Contact our Customer Service team via email or phone within 30 days of receiving your order.
Provide your order number, the item you’d like to exchange, and the reason for the exchange.
Our team will guide you through the next steps.
<br><br>
3. Exchange Process

Once we receive your return request and the item meets the exchange eligibility criteria, we will provide you with instructions on how to return the item.
The exchanged item will be shipped once we receive the returned product.
If the item you wish to exchange for is out of stock, we will offer you a store credit or refund based on your preference.
<br><br>
4. Shipping Costs for Exchanges

The customer is responsible for the cost of return shipping unless the exchange is due to a defective or incorrect item received.
We recommend using a trackable shipping service for your return, as we cannot guarantee receipt of your returned item without tracking.
<br><br>
5. Exchange Limitations

Exchanges are only allowed for items of equal or lesser value. If you wish to exchange for a higher-priced item, you may need to pay the price difference.
Items purchased using a gift card or during a promotional sale are subject to specific exchange restrictions.
<br><br>
6. Non-Eligible Items for Exchange

Final sale items, including clearance items, are not eligible for exchanges.
Items purchased after the exchange window (30 days from delivery) are not eligible for exchange.
<br><br>
7. Damaged or Defective Items

If you receive a damaged or defective item, please contact us immediately upon receiving your order. We will gladly replace the defective item or provide a full refund, including shipping costs.
8. Refunds

If an exchange is not possible, we can issue a full refund to your original method of payment.
<br>
